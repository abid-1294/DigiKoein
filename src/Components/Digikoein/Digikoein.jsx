          <p>
            DIGI KOEIN is created and developed by a group of the financial
            experts under the company of
            <span className="pspan"> Green Shark Limited</span> to prompt a
            technological innovation and to positively alter the financial
            industry practice and the life of people. The ways to use “Money”
            are below observed and divided into three categories: <br />
            1) Fund Transfer; 2) Payment and 3) Currency Exchanges. <br />
            <br />
            However, the industry practice currently adopted, to some extent,
            hinders a full-fledged technological and economic growth in terms
            of the usage of Money. The global and independent platform created
            through DIGI KOEIN Blockchain/Distributed Ledger Technology shall
            get the divided ways of “Money” usage bundled and integrated to
            remove the current sintermediaries, and to offer the alternative
            solutions. <br />
            <br />
            The technology shall ultimately expand its horizon to be used in a
            variety of financial services including credits and loans, trade
            finance, and others. At this stage, it is certain that the market
            recognition and brand name of DIGI KOEIN will be explosively
            heightened.
